# DataProcessingUsingPython
This repo contains a notebook demonstrating how to extract required information from any csv with just using pandas and seaborn for plotting; and a folder consisting results of the extraction. 

The imports are pandas, seaborn and matplotlib.

Note: One of the files was large so git didn't allow me to push it, you can look that in the notebook the file contained the float prices and the currency seperated from the price_string.
